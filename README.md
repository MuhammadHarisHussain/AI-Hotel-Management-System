# AI Hotel Management System

An AI-powered hotel management system built in Python.  
This project integrates machine learning / AI models with hotel operations to automate and optimize tasks like booking, check-in/check-out, room assignment, and more.

---

## 📌 Features

- Booking and reservation management  
- Automated check-in / check-out  
- Room allocation / assignment logic  
- AI / ML modules for demand forecasting, pricing, or recommendations  
- Administrative dashboard / interface for staff  
- Database integration for persistence  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Components

- **Main_Page.py** — Entry-point for the system  
- **DatabaseManager.py** — Handles database connections and queries  
- **ai_models.py** — AI / ML logic (forecasting, optimization, recommendation)  
- **commands_&_Data_Input.sql** — SQL script(s) to set up the initial database schema and data  
- **Images/** — Screenshots, diagrams, or assets  
- **pages/** — Additional UI / feature modules

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Database (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)  

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadHarisHussain/AI-Hotel-Management-System.git
   cd AI-Hotel-Management-System
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   - Run `commands_&_Data_Input.sql` to create tables and seed data  
   - Update database credentials in `DatabaseManager.py` if needed  

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python Main_Page.py
   ```

## 🗄️ Database & Data

- The SQL file **commands_&_Data_Input.sql** defines schema and seed data  
- Example tables: `Guests`, `Reservations`, `Rooms`, `Transactions`, etc.  
- All queries and CRUD operations are handled through **DatabaseManager.py**  

---

## 🤖 AI / ML Models

- AI logic lives in **ai_models.py**  
- Possible tasks:
  - Demand forecasting (predict occupancy rates)  
  - Dynamic pricing models  
  - Upgrade or offer recommendations  
- Models can be trained, tested, and integrated with reservation workflows
